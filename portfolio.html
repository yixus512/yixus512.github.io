                <h3> This website! </h3>
                <p> I made this website with two primary intentions. Firstly, to gain experience with HTML, CSS, and the general workings of website 
                    creation. Secondly, so that I could have a place where I could describe in detail the things that I can only mention or summarize on 
                    a resume. So far this is a lot of fun!

                <h3> IMRS </h3>
                <p> For my senior capstone project, two teams of UNT students are working together to create the Incident Monitoring and Response System 
                    &#40;IMRS&#41;, with the sponsorship of A-Shield, LLC. IMRS is a system that will allow students, teachers, and staff in active shooter 
                    situations to quickly provide information to law enforcement as to the whereabouts of the shooter. Currently, this system is in the 
                    design phase, but will use AWS infrastructure to get location and status information from students, teachers, and staff to law enforcement.
