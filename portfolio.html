								<h3> This website! </h3>
									<p> 
										I made this website with two primary intentions. Firstly, to gain experience with HTML, CSS, and the general workings of website 
									    creation. Secondly, so that I could have a place where I could describe in detail the things that I can only mention or summarize on 
									    a resume. So far this is a lot of fun!

									<h3> IMRS </h3>
									<p> 
										For my senior capstone project, two teams of UNT students are working together to create the Incident Monitoring and Response System 
									    &#40;IMRS&#41;, with the sponsorship of A-Shield, LLC. IMRS is a system that will allow students, teachers, and staff in active shooter 
									    situations to quickly provide information to law enforcement as to the whereabouts of the shooter. Currently, this system is in the 
									    design phase, but will use AWS infrastructure to get location and status information from students, teachers, and staff to law enforcement.

								<h3> Password Manager  </h3>
									<p> 
										For my Foundations of Cybersecurity class, the end of the semester project that we worked on allowed us to choose between several project 
						   				types. I chose to make a simple password manager. The program was written in Java, and I used the JavaFX framework to create the GUI. 
					    				User passwords were encrypted using AES-256, and the program required the entry of a key unique to the user in order to view the encrypted 
						    			passwords.
