        		    <h2> About me </h2>
	        		    <p>
		        		Hi! My name is Logan and I'm currently a University of North Texas student working on a bachelor's in computer science which I will complete
        				in May of 2024. Originally, I didn't go into college as a CS major, but when I took my first computer science class I fell in love with 
	        			coding. My following semester I decided that I would enjoy my professional career much more as a developer rather than as 
		        		an electrical engineer, so I made the switch and have been spending long days staring at my computer screen ever since.
			        	<br>
	        			One of my favorite things about computer science is getting to know how the sausage is made. Being able to interact with software and 
        				technology that I use every day and know how it works brings me immense joy. So far I've learned about databases and SQL. 
        				I've learned languages like C/C++, Python, and Java. I've picked up HTML and CSS in making this very site. I've also learned a lot about 
	        			how the internet works. From ethernet frames and how they get from point A to point B, to encryption and other cybersecurity techniques that makes 
		        		using the internet safe.
			        	<br>
		        		I always have some ideas in my head about what I might make next. If only I had the time and energy to work on them all.
			            </p>
            			    <h3> Skillset </h3>
	            			    <h4> Languages</h4>
			        		    <p> The languages I've used include</p>
			            		<ul>
					                <li> C/C++ </li>
			            		    <li> Python </li> <!--perahps put language icons here-->
				            	    <li> Java </li>
					                <li> HTML/CSS </li>
					                <li> SQL </li>
					                <!-- if I end up using JS for this, put JS here -->
					            </ul>
				                <h4> I also know how to use </h4>
					            <ul>
					                <li> SQL </li>
					                <li> Git </li>
					                <li> GitHub/GitLab </li>
					                <li> Google </li>
					            </ul>
			                <h3> When I'm not online </h3>
				            <p>
					        I like to listen to lots of music, and I could talk about it all day. So instead, here's some of my favorite albums by my favorite artists:

				            <p> 
        					As alluded to above, I also play music; I've been playing guitar, bass, and drums since I was 13. In addition to being fun, I  find that 
		        			playing an instrument is a great way to reset when I've been stuck on something for too long.
				        	I also like to keep up with the other American football (MLS), and root for Austin FC. Vamos verde!
