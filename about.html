            <h2> About me </h2>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Logan and I'm currently a University of North Texas student working on a bachelor's in computer science which I will complete
                in May of 2024. Originally, I didn't go into college as a CS major. I started out as a music major, but switched to electrical engineering 
                after I decided I wanted to keep music as a personal hobby. This went without a hitch until I took my first computer science class and I fell 
                in love with coding. My following semester I decided that I would enjoy my professional career much more as a developer rather than as 
                an electrical engineer, so I made the switch and have been spending long days staring at my computer screen ever since.
            </p>
            <h3> Skillset </h3>
            <p>
                Primarily, my coding vocabulary is in object oriented languages like Python, C/C++, and Java. I also have experience with SQL and AWS, and I
                have taken classes on networking and cybersecurity. In creating this website, my goal was to become familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                and I feel the final result speaks for itself.
            </p>
            <h3> When I'm not online </h3>
            <p>
                I like to listen to lots of music, and I could talk about it all day. So instead, here's some of my favorite albums by my favorite artists:

                As alluded to above, I also play music; I've been playing guitar, bass, and drums since I was 13. In addition to being fun, I  find that 
                playing an instrument is a great way to reset when I've been stuck on something for too long.
