		        		Hi! My name is Logan and I'm currently a University of North Texas student working on a bachelor's in computer science which I will complete
        				in May of 2024. Originally, I didn't go into college as a CS major, but when I took my first computer science class I fell in love with 
	        			coding. My following semester I decided that I would enjoy my professional career much more as a developer rather than as 
		        		an electrical engineer, so I made the switch and have been spending long days staring at my computer screen ever since.
			        	<br>
						<br>
		        		I always have some ideas in my head about what I work on in my free time next, and once I get into the groove, my personal projects are all 
						I want to work on when I've finished my work for the day.

            			    <h3> Skillset </h3>
								<p>
									My frist classes in college taught me to code in C/C++, so I have the most experience with them in particular. When I've worked on GUI projects
									, I used Java and JavaFX. Recently, in an effort to become more well rounded, I've begun using Python to write some projects,
									and of course in making this website I've had to become at least a little familiar with HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I've also taken a class
									on database systems, which gave me a familiarity with SQL and relational databases. Additionally, with my degree plan including a security 
									certificate, I have knowledge on ensuring user, program, and network safety.

				            <p>
					        I like to listen to lots of music, and I could talk about it all day. So instead, here's some of my favorite albums by my favorite artists:

        					As alluded to above, I also play music; I've been playing guitar, bass, and drums since I was 13. In addition to being fun, I  find that 
		        			playing an instrument is a great way to reset when I've been stuck on something for too long.
				        	I also like to keep up with the other American football (MLS), and root for Austin FC. Vamos verde!
